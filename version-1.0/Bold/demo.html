This is the melancholy of the demise of a world, the last        world where the security of myth still counterpoised history, and for        this melancholy everything worldly moves only toward corruption. The        great revolts of the European peasants are also their attempt to respond        to history-which was violently wrenching the peasants out of the        patriarchal sleep that had guaranteed their feudal tutelage. This        millenarian utopia of achieving heaven on earth revives what was at the        origin of semi-historical religion, when Christian communities which        grew out of Judaic messianism responded to the troubles and unhappiness        of the epoch by looking to the imminent realization of the Kingdom of        God and brought a disquieting and subversive factor into ancient        society. When Christianity reached the point of sharing power within the        empire, it exposed what still survived of this hope as a simple        superstition: that is the meaning of the Augustinian affirmation,        archetype of all the satisfecit of modern ideology, according to which        the established Church has already for a long time been this kingdom one        spoke of. The social revolt of the millenarian peasantry defines itself        naturally first of all as a will to destroy the Church. But        millenarianism spreads in the historical world, and not on the terrain        of myth. Modern revolutionary expectations are not irrational        continuations of the religious passion of millenarianism, as Norman Cohn        thought he had demonstrated in The Pursuit of the Millennium. On the        contrary, it is millenarianism, revolutionary class struggle speaking        the language of religion for the last time, which is already a modern        revolutionary tendency that as yet lacks the consciousness that it is        only historical. The millenarians had to lose because they could not        recognize the revolution as their own operation. The fact that they        waited to act on the basis of an external sign of God's decision is the        translation into thought of the practice of insurgent peasants following        chiefs taken from outside their ranks. The peasant class could not        attain an adequate consciousness of the functioning of society or of the        way to lead its own struggle: because it lacked these conditions of        unity in its action and consciousness, it expressed its project and led        its wars with the imagery of an earthly paradise..</p>    </div>  </body></html>
